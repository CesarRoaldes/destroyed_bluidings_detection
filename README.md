# Syrian war and satellite imagery classification

The Syrian conflict has been the biggest humanitarian crisis in recent time taking the live of millions of people and destroying urban centers and infrastructures in the country. Due to restricted access, security issue as well as dysfunction of main institutions the scale of the destruction remains to be estimated accurately. This work aims at giving a clue on the later. Building on satellite imagery and the huge work of the UNITAR-UNOSAT\footnote{UNITAR-UNOSAT is the UN satellite imagery programme} we construct a classifier that recognizes destructed infrastructures and buildings in main Syrian urban centers. Based on this algorithm we then propose a mapping of destruction for several cities in Syria were information is still very scarce. Further improvments are finally proposed.
